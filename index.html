      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>Our process revolves around pre-planning. It becomes counter productive when we don't mix up the routines we follow in the gym, but how are you to remeber what you did yesterday let alone last week? That's where we step in.</p>
      <p>Start by adding a new workout to your account. Don't forget to give a unique name or date so that you rember when your workout was. Next, add your favorite exercises, or the ones your trainer gives you so you won't feel lost when your in the gym. Don't forge to write in the amount of time or reps!</p>
